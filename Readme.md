Would you like state-of-the-art modern cmake 3 build with all the fancy features ready to go like address, memory, thread and undefined behaviour sanitisers, clang-tidy linting, doxygen docs generation, git submodule dependency tracking and ABI version stamping, C++ Modules support and more?

Would you like to generate partially preprocessed single header file editions of your library for maximum convenience and ease of install for your end users?

Would you like a collection of highly reusable useful routines and code built on top of the C++ 14 STL?

Then this is the library you've been looking for! Designed for use as an embedded git submodule, but can also be used as a partially preprocessed single file download with ONLY the specific bits your library uses.
